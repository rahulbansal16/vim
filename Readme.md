Exploring the possibility to convert any text box or text area on any application to a Vim-like editor.

For the version 1, it can have insert mode and normal mode.

The user should be able to perform the following things when an input box is focused.
1. Pressing i should enable insert mode.
2. Pressing Esc should take to normal mode and the user should be able to perform things like navigate, delete, etc

If that works more advanced use cases like selection, searching, etc can also be built.

Grammarly for Desktop is able to detect text and show UIs on top of other applications. 
so my understanding is that, it might be possible to emulate a layer of vim on existing  text box or text area.

What are your suggestions on this?
